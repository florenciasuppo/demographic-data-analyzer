# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum and analyzes demographic data from the [Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).  
It uses Python and the Pandas library to calculate statistics such as average age, education levels, income distributions, and more.

##What it does

- Counts people by race
- Calculates the average age of men
- Computes the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree
- Finds out how many people with higher/lower education earn more than $50K
- Determines the minimum hours worked per week and income distribution
- Identifies the country with the highest percentage of rich people

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install Pandas if you haven't already:
3. Place the `adult.data.csv` file in the same folder as the Python script.
4. Run the script.
